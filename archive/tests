Hej Ralph

Thanks for a fast fix of your SRU Server tester
http://alcme.oclc.org/srw/SRUServerTester.html
for the Alvis-Zebra SRU server URL
http://foo.indexdata.dk

I think your SRU checker does a nice job. And it did indeed find some 
errors in our implementation, so we all can improve. Thanks for that!

I have a couple of small comments:


1)
You test scan like this:

http://foo.indexdata.dk?version=1.1&scanClause=rec.id+=+dog&operation=scan&responsePosition=1&maximumTerms=5

I think you should always add a responsePosition=3 to the mix, as there 
might be indexes (and there are here!) where the term 'dog' comes 
lexocographically after the last index entry, and you get a fat empty

<zs:scanResponse>
<zs:version>1.1</zs:version>
</zs:scanResponse>

But using

http://foo.indexdata.dk/?version=1.1&operation=scan&scanClause=rec.id+%3D+%28dog%29&responsePosition=3&maximumTerms=5&stylesheet=

gives you

<zs:scanResponse>
<zs:version>1.1</zs:version>
<zs:terms>
<zs:term>
<zs:value>FFFEBE6A0D7773AF401A728D5C818AEB</zs:value>
<zs:numberOfRecords>1</zs:numberOfRecords>
</zs:term>
<zs:term>
<zs:value>FFFF3A78648AC540304B1F50A2C0D644</zs:value>
<zs:numberOfRecords>1</zs:numberOfRecords>
</zs:term>
</zs:terms>
</zs:scanResponse>

By the way, an empty index is not that useful, but I think it's not 
necessarily an error to have one unpopulated index, so using a warning 
from your side is a good choice, I feel.


2) scan relation 'exact'

You try
http://foo.indexdata.dk?version=1.1&scanClause=rec.id+exact+dog&operation=scan&responsePosition=1&maximumTerms=5

with relation 'exact', but my explain never told you that the server 
supports relation 'exact'.

I think, my correct server response to this should be a fatal 
diagnostic, and your correct test result should have been 'diagnostic 
this-and-that expected'.

Unless it's mandatory that any index supports 'exact', in which case an 
error should be reported (I need to look in the specs to be sure ..)

3) test of search retrieve

You are doing a decent job here. I have a suggestion for a slight 
improvement: you might want to use your information from a scan in the 
follwing way:

- search for a term _not_ found in the index, and see that there are 0
   hits (and the response is correct)

- search for at term found in the scan response, and see that the number
   of hits equals the number of hits claimed in the scan response

I know, it's more work to check for numbers, but it's also a nice sanity 
check on top of a syntax/protocol check.

4) huge records: some of the records are insane huge (up to 5 MB of 
XML). For example you hit one here:

http://foo.indexdata.dk?version=1.1&query=alvis.entity-disease+=+"dominant 
optic atrophy"&operation=searchRetrieve&maximumRecords=1

You might want to test for XML response message size before doing 
anything else to it, and report a warning like 'response too huge to be 
tested, exceeds X MB of XML'

(I know, I should use anotheÅ• default schema here, to give small 
records, for example the 'dc' schema. We have to improve too ..)

5) recordSchema
In these cases, one might want to try the other record schema's to see 
if one get something useful there .. I did not see you testing any 
recordSchema of those I did mention, nor testing non-existent record 
schema's ..

6) In general, testing with wrong arguments on almost any place one can 
do is a good idea as well, as the hardest part of SRU/SRW is to get the 
diagnostics right ..  for example record position too high, or 
non-existing relaiton or index, non-existing operation .. ect ..
(Yes, I know, this is huge work to do ..)

7) Finally, useability: I think it's a nice idea to have this report 
formatted in XHTML tables, with nice links to click on for each test 
case, such that one can just execute the request which did produce 
errors/warnings. This is of course only eye-candy, but also a cheap 
improvement of useability.


Still, I think  you did a very decent job, and created  a very useful 
service. I thank for the problems discovered with my service. I have 
some programming to do as well ..

Guys,

Anders has asked me to list the test that the Z-Spy performs.

    * Test Bib-1 attributes from atrribute 1-1036
    * Test the extended Bib-1 attributes 1037-1096
    * Test the extended DubliCore attributes 1097-1111
    * Test the GILS attributes 1112-1184
    * Test the extended Bib-1 attributes 1085-1209
    * Test the Dan-1 attributes 1-27
    * Test what record foamats the target i capable of returning from
      the list: DANMARC USMARC JPMARC UNIMARC CANMARC NORMARC UKMARC
      PICAMARC IBERMARC INTERMARC LIBRISMARC GRS-1 SUTRS XML OPAC
      SUMMARY MAB RUSMARC SWEMARC
    * Test what parts of Explain the server supports from the list:
      CategoryList TargetInfo DatabaseInfo SchemaInfo TagSetInfo
      RecordSyntaxInfo AttributeSetInfo TermListInfo
      ExtendedServicesInfo AttributeDetails TermListDetails
      ElementSetDetails RetrivalRecordDetails SortDetails Processing
      VariantSetInfo UnitSet
    * Test support of bolean operators: and or not
    * Test what services the target supports

Apart from that Z-Spy has the following features:

    * When a server closes the connection in the middel of a test, Z-Spy
      can reconnect and continue the test where it crashed.
    * When a test has failed n number of times, with the same error, an
      email is send to the sys admin.
    * Z-Spy can put a sleap in between the serches in order not to
      stress the target too much
    * To begin with a query with a common word is used, until a record
      has been found so that the record format test can be performed.
      When this record has been formed, the query is switched to
      something more uncommon like "askdndd" in order to stress the
      server as little as possible.
