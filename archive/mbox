Hi Per, Seb.

I'm pleased to announce some good progress now on IRSpy, although
tomorrow's one-day conference and next week's three-dayer come at an
irritating time just the framework is pretty much in place.  If you
want to play with it, feel free (cvs co irspy) or you could leave it a
week or two until I have it purring properly.

The framework is there now to run sets of tests, each of which is
coded as a plugin Perl module with a straightforward API.  So far,
though I've only made two -- "Ping" which just checks the connection,
and "Search::Title" which checks whether a simple @attr 1=4 title
works.  (Actually, three tests: there's also "Main", which does
nothing but invoke the other two.)  Each test plugin class is defined
as a subclass of a base "Test" class.

Aside from adding many more tests, the main thing that needs to be
done is giving the test a way to permanently register their results,
which they'll do by updating an IRSpy::Record structure which is
initially built from the stored ZeeRex record and is, when the test
are complete, serialised back to ZeeRex and written back to the
controlling database.  That part is not yet done, depending as it does
on defining the necessary ZeeRex extensions.  With a trailing wind,
I'll get it done on Friday.

I'm sorry it's taken so long to get to this point.  Hopefully from
here on everything will speed up dramatically.
