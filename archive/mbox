Subject: IRSpy Progress
Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2006 17:36:28 +0100 (BST)

Hi Per, Seb.

I'm pleased to announce some good progress now on IRSpy, although
tomorrow's one-day conference and next week's three-dayer come at an
irritating time just the framework is pretty much in place.  If you
want to play with it, feel free (cvs co irspy) or you could leave it a
week or two until I have it purring properly.

The framework is there now to run sets of tests, each of which is
coded as a plugin Perl module with a straightforward API.  So far,
though I've only made two -- "Ping" which just checks the connection,
and "Search::Title" which checks whether a simple @attr 1=4 title
works.  (Actually, three tests: there's also "Main", which does
nothing but invoke the other two.)  Each test plugin class is defined
as a subclass of a base "Test" class.

Aside from adding many more tests, the main thing that needs to be
done is giving the test a way to permanently register their results,
which they'll do by updating an IRSpy::Record structure which is
initially built from the stored ZeeRex record and is, when the test
are complete, serialised back to ZeeRex and written back to the
controlling database.  That part is not yet done, depending as it does
on defining the necessary ZeeRex extensions.  With a trailing wind,
I'll get it done on Friday.

I'm sorry it's taken so long to get to this point.  Hopefully from
here on everything will speed up dramatically.

Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2007 10:19:29 +0300

Hello Mike,

After some internal discussions we have decided to proceed with the 
IRSpy testing in the following manner:

1. Initial testing, to be carried out by Ms. Katri Kananen, will 
concentrate on end user point of view. Katri is very experienced copy 
cataloger who is familiar with both Z39.50 and BookWhere. Comparing the 
target data in BookWhere (which has been manually produced) and in IRSpy 
will provide some views on how reliable automatically generated data is. 
Since IRSpy contains more targets than BookWhere (2600 to about 2000) 
Katri will also be able to add new targets to BookWhere and see how they 
"work".

2. After Katri has finished her part of the work in late May / early 
June we'll proceed to technical testing, to be carried out by Ere 
Maijala whose background is in programming. Since Ere's schedule is 
tight (his main responsibility is our MetaLib/SFX portal) I am not sure 
how much time he'll be able to spend on testing, but we'll see what 
happens. Implementation of the new MetaLib version keeps Ere and his 
colleagues busy for the time being. But we wish to complete testing 
before summer vacations; I hope this is OK for ID.

It is our belief that IRSpy will help us in two areas, BookWhere-based 
copy cataloguing and MetaLib portal maintenance. The testers represent 
these two areas, and the outcome of the test will already provide some 
insights of how useful the tool will be, for the national library and 
for the (Finnish) library network in general.

If Adam and his colleagues are able to test this version of the 
application (like they have tested earlier releases), we would like to 
receive a report of the results too, in order to avoid re-inventing the 
same wheels.

I have taken a short look at IRSpy. One feature I missed was geographic 
location (country) of the server, which in many cases could be easily 
derived from the host name. Browsing an alphabetical list for Finnish 
servers was rather frustrating, and a copy cataloguer would prefer a 
country-based representation of servers. Moreover, there are quite a lot 
of servers with 0 % reliability, eventually some kind of weeding  
process should be implemented for the servers which obviously are no 
longer functional at all or have moved to some other place. Presentation 
of the supported attributes is as compact as it gets; lay users might 
prefer a more verbose option should one be available.

But in spite of these critical comments, I am quite happy with what I've 
seen. The number of target systems is already quite impressive and is 
likely to grow when IRSpy goes live. The system works fast enough, and I 
like the looks of it.

Best regards,

Juha

OK, sounds good.

This seems an awfully long way into the future.

I'll leave Per or Seb to comment on that.

Certainly.  May we once more invite you to register all bugs, change
requests, etc. in the Bugzilla area?  That way everyone can see
what everyone else has found and we can be sure that nothing gets forgotten.

The problem is that "in many cases" is not really good enough.  You'll
have seen that there is indeed a Country field in the records, but we
feel that it is better to edit these by hand than to have a computer
make guesses.  However --

Well, that's what searching is for!  :-)

If you want to narrow by domain-name, try this.  Go to:
	http://irspy.indexdata.com/find.html
In the "Host" field, enter
	*.fi
Set the "Sort by" dropdown to
	Title
And press the Search button.

At the moment, there seems to be only one matching entry (which makes
the sorting criterion a bit irrelevant :-)  This was a surprise to me,
but does seem to be correct.

Yes.  Someone will have to come up with heuristics -- I suppose
something simple such as "no successful connections in six months"
would be about right.

 > Presentation of the supported attributes is as compact as it gets;

You mean this?

	Bib-1 Use attributes  	36 access points: 1-9, 12-13, 16-19,
	                        21, 25, 28, 33-44, 47, 1003, 1007,
	                        1016, 1035-1036

You're thinking that users might prefer to see "33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44" rather than "33-44"?  I have to say that
does not seem likely to me.

Thanks, that's good to hear!

Dear Per,

We did not want to spend much time on testing the application until it=20
was declared to be ready by Index Data. Any testing done on earlier=20
versions must be repeated with the final release, and the time spent on=20
testing would increase accordingly.

We assumed that testing would take place late 2006, and we had a=20
seasoned programmer who would have been able to take care of the task.=20
He left us in the end of December as planned, so at the moment we do not=20
have a technical expert available for testing on short notice. Please=20
keep in mind that we could not prepare ourselves properly for testing in=20
2007 also because we did not know exactly when ID will be able to=20
complete the IRSpy development. Once Mike's note about IRSpy being=20
available for testing arrived, following discussions with other=20
directors and experts within the library, I came up with the plan sent=20
to Mike Taylor earlier today.

Paying the entire invoice before the testing is completed is not what we=20
normally do, even with good partners such as ID. Your proposal will be=20
discussed in the library board, but I must admit that my gut feeling is=20
that the answer will be negative. From our point of view it is not=20
entirely our fault that we can not complete the testing fast. I do not=20
remember if our contract says anything about how fast we are assumed to=20
carry out the testing; if it does, then we have to reconsider the=20
testing proposal I have drafted.

I'm sorry for being a bit negative this time. But we have bought a lot=20
of software from various vendors, and there are some principles we=20
always stick to. What you propose would be against some of them.

Best regards,

Juha Hakala

Hello Mike,

See comments below. There are not many of them.

As regards the timing of the test over here: I am sorry that we can not 
start the technical testing any faster. Late last year - when IRSpy was 
supposed to be available for testing - we did have a qualified person, 
but he is no longer with us.

I was not able to find a single Finnish server via browsing; my patience 
ran out first. Many Finnish sites that are definitely free (like most 
OPACs in university libraries) are missing from the IRSpy server list, 
although it is probably the most complete one in existence. This shows 
only that there are a lot more Z & SRU servers out there than we know, 
and the fact that the libraries have not been able to share this 
information efficiently between themselves keeps many useful services 
hidden from users such as copy cataloguers or patrons with specific 
regional interests. Patrons with specific topical interests would of 
course need collection descriptions, but that is a different story.

That would not seem likely to me either :-).

Instead of verbose I should have said human readable (sorry, I am not a 
native English speaker and sometimes pick a wrong term or make a mess of 
the grammar). Especially if you don't have Z39.50 readily at hand it may 
be a bit difficult to find out what f.ex. Use attribute 7 means. Most 
human users (especially those who are not system analysts but e.g. 
cataloguers) might well prefer a display stating "ISBN" instead of "7", 
especially if they only want to see if ISBN searching is possible. Of 
course it is possible to check from Bib-1 the meaning of the codes, and 
eventually one memorizes quite a few of them, but why should we make it 
necessary to the users to take that extra step?

Best regards,

Juha

I do take your point.

Probably because there is only the one!  But of course you are very
welcome to add more.

All true.  Please help to fix this problem!  :-)

You _are_ joking here, right?  Like most Scandivians, your written
English is _far_ better than that of most native Brits.

Gotcha.  I agree that it would be a nice enhancement to be able to see
the codes interpreted.

Would you please add this feature request using Bugzilla?  Not only
will that make sure it gets done, but it will also reassure us at ID
that you are comfortable using the system.  Thanks.

Kjaere Mike,

I added a couple of bug reports, comments, questions to bugzilla. I 
also amended a previous bug report of someone else. I wanted to 
attach a screenshot to one of the report (1093) but I did not find an 
attach button, so I'm attaching that to this letter.

I think we have already finished the test. I'm looking forward to 
your answers.

I've attached it to the bug for you.  (It's the "Create a New
Attachment" link -- I agree that the Bugzilla UI is pretty horrible.
On the positive side, it makes IRSpy look good in comparison :-)

Well that is one way of handling it, I guess, but I think that we should 
make a formal deliverable. Can we make some kind of package for them 
that we can send?

Ah, well, that one is to do with character sets.  You can't possibly
expect that to be fixed!

Just joking, ha ha.  No, the problem with this one is that the
database name, hence the ID, has a space in it:
	Z39.50:bissen.odont.au.dk:21/Odontologisk Bibliotek

That is in fact provoking the same problem as non-ASCII characters in
an ID do, which is that when you submit such an ID as recordIdOpaque
in and Extended Services request, it is interpreted differently from
when it's submitted as part of a record that XS extracts the ID from
itself.  It still seems wrong to me that Zebra does this, but it's
possible to work around.

In fact, I just have: I fixed this in CVS and on the live site.

Sure thing.  Here it is, including the edit-record-with-funny-ID fix
described above.
