It seems wrong that in IRSpy we have a database of 6000 Z39.50
targets, but no easy way to make them available to MasterKey
applications.  Since Jason built the IRSpy toroid, which exposes
IRSpy's ZeeRex database in Torus format, it seems that have had the
pieces we need to present those 6000 databases to MasterKey
administrators; but in reality there are several significant barriers
to using the toroid output.

data quality
data richness -- more tests needed
irspy overnight test fixed
mkadmin handling many targets
