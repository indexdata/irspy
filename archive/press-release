Hello to everyone on my Index Data news distribution list.  I hope 
this note finds you all engaged and feeling well.  I am pleased to be 
able to report, with the following announcement, that Index Data is 
advancing the standardization of metasearching in a way that we are 
confident will result in significant cost savings for the library community.

INDEX DATA DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT SUPPORTS NISO METASEARCH INITIATIVE

April 5, 2006 - West Hartford, CT - Index Data, the premier developer 
of Open Source information retrieval software for libraries and their 
vendors, has just signed a contract with Helsinki University Library, 
The National Library of Finland, to develop an information retrieval 
target monitoring and analysis tool. This software, which is being 
released under the name Keystone Target Manager, will be designed to 
meet the specifications of the NISO draft standard Z39.92: 
Information Retrieval Service Description, which is based on an 
earlier community standard called ZeeRex.

The Keystone Target Manager will perform the following services:
    * Automatically monitor a collection of Z39.50/SRW/SRU targets, 
maintaining statistics for availability over time.
    * Provide configurable alerting services when targets become unavailable.
    * Automatically gather information about the search capabilities 
of targets that use standard search protocols, such as 
Z39.50/SRW/SRU, for use in configuring IR clients of different types.
    * Make the gathered information available in a software-readable 
form, as a database of ZeeRex (ANSI/NISO Z39.92) records. (This will 
enable sharing of this information via the Internet.)
Juha Hakala, Director of Information Technology at Helsinki 
University Library and Chair of the NISO Committee which developed 
the NISO Z39.92 draft standard, points out that "up to now 
information about Z39.50 or SRU/SRW targets has usually been 
discovered and documented manually, which is a laborious and time 
consuming process. Also, there has been no efficient means of 
exchanging this data among metasearch applications such as portals. 
While NISO Z39.92, solves the latter problem, the Keystone Target 
Manager will simplify the process of creating accurate target 
descriptions and keeping them up-to-date."

"Given the expertise Index Data has in implementing Z39.50 and 
SRU/SRW applications," Hakala continued, "I am confident that the 
service descriptions generated by the Target Manager will be useful. 
It will be interesting to see how quickly the IR portal vendors and 
maintenance agencies such as libraries will adopt this target 
management tool, and start sharing on a global scale the target 
descriptions harvested with it."

Pat Stevens, the Interim Executive Director of NISO, was delighted to 
learn about this agreement: "NISO thanks Helsinki University and 
Index Data for their collaborative work on this project," she stated. 
"It comes at just the right time as organizations are now looking for 
an effective way to implement Z39.92."

The Keystone Target Manager will be a major step forward in 
standardizing and reducing the costs of maintaining target gateways 
for metasearch services. Content providers that support standardized 
search interfaces, and federated search services that take advantage 
of this soon-to-be-released Open Source/Open Access target management 
service, will together be able to reduce the cost of providing 
federated search services to libraries. If these lower costs are 
passed on to libraries in the form of reduced gateway maintenance 
fees, libraries will be able to shift costs from access mechanisms to 
licensing content.

About Index Data

Index Data has been developing standards-based information retrieval 
technology since 1994. Library software vendors as varied as Ex 
Libris, Fretwell-Downing, Geac, ISACSOFT, Koha and Polaris use Index 
Data's technology in the software they provide to libraries. And 
libraries around the world, including the Library of Congress and 
many other national libraries, use the company's technology and 
services to meet demanding and sophisticated information retrieval 
challenges. The company's metasearch service, Keystone Retriever, is 
among the most advanced in the industry and is distributed under an 
Open Source license.
