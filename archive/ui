Look great, Mike.

 I have a few comments:

    * In the Add target screen I had envisioned a lot more fields for
      entering data about the server. First of all we need a Name field.
      Second it think we should have a section with additional info
      about the target, like URL to hosting org. Email to technical
      contact (that is the mail we use to send mails to when we
      encounter a problem with the server), Username and password, Type
      of library (probably a dropdown with, Academic, Public, Corporate,
      Special, National, Education, Other) and Country.
    * In the display of the targets you should have room or at least
      some way of showing this additional info. Maybe some kind of mouse
      over or popup.
    * In the target display, eg. under R the display of non ASCII
      characters goes wrong.

Then I have some questions:

    * How are you going to handle targets that has (permanent) errors?
      Will they be marked or excluded from the list?
    * How are you going to handle email notification of technical
      contact persons with targets that has permanent errors?
    * Have you thought about a statistics page like in Z-Spy?
    * When added a target, can you handle targets with multiple
      databases? How do you write the database names in the inputbox?
    * When adding a new target do you have a check if the target is
      there already, maybe registered with the IP instead of the hostname?
    * Should we get a designer to give the site an overhaul?

Yep, most or all of that fits into the ZeeRex record.  The current
version doesn't have any of it, because it's using the IRSpy ability
to quietly add a new record as a side-effect of running the tests on a
not-previously-known target; but when I do the proper "Add a target"
page, it'll have a lot more spaces.  Also, the option of uploading a
pre-made ZeeRex record.

Hadn't thought of those approaches -- I was just going to have a
"[Details]" link.  IIRC, mouseover is easy to do with compliant XHTML
(which is what I use anyway) so maybe I'll try it that way.

Oh *%^$!  Freakin' character-sets!  :-)

Thanks, I'll look into that.

Open to discussion.  The first question I suppose is what would count
as "permanent" -- no response for six months?

 >     * How are you going to handle email notification of technical
 >       contact persons with targets that has permanent errors?

Easily enough for targets whose ZeeRex records have a contact email in
them!  For others, I guess falling back to <hostmaster@domain> is the
best we can do automatically?

 >     * Have you thought about a statistics page like in Z-Spy?

Patience, my pretty!

In ZeeRex terms, each target is a single database -- so a Z-server
that has multiple databases would register each of them as a separate
target that just happens to have the same host and port as its
buddies.

Nope.  Do you think I should?

Given how far over time (and so over budget!) we already are, I
wouldn't have thought so.  But once it's all working functionally, we
can revisit that and figure out what we want to do with the cosmetics.

(What's wrong with it, anyway?  Does it need a Hot Chick in the banner
area at the top?)

In Z-Spy we contact the administrator if the target is down 3 times in a 
row, which in praxis means 3 days in a row, and that has worked well 
over the years. This has to be configurable of course. In Z-Spy, we do 
not fall back to administrator/hostmaster/info@domain, but that is nice 
idea.

Sounds OK, but wont you get the same problem as Z-Spy, where it is very 
hard to display this target as one server with multiple databases under, 
as in one line in the display? Wouldn't you need to have each database 
on a new line and the user would then have to discover by her self that 
say line 5, 6 and 7 is actually one server with different databases.

You are probably right.

My experience is that a nice design is essential for how the customer 
evaluates the software. If it looks nice the software is also more 
likely to be evaluated as high quality. Your design is not ugly or 
anything but is obvious that is not something that has been spend a lot 
of time on, but lets keep it that way for the time being.
