Guys,

Anders has asked me to list the test that the Z-Spy performs.

    * Test Bib-1 attributes from atrribute 1-1036
    * Test the extended Bib-1 attributes 1037-1096
    * Test the extended DubliCore attributes 1097-1111
    * Test the GILS attributes 1112-1184
    * Test the extended Bib-1 attributes 1085-1209
    * Test the Dan-1 attributes 1-27
    * Test what record foamats the target i capable of returning from
      the list: DANMARC USMARC JPMARC UNIMARC CANMARC NORMARC UKMARC
      PICAMARC IBERMARC INTERMARC LIBRISMARC GRS-1 SUTRS XML OPAC
      SUMMARY MAB RUSMARC SWEMARC
    * Test what parts of Explain the server supports from the list:
      CategoryList TargetInfo DatabaseInfo SchemaInfo TagSetInfo
      RecordSyntaxInfo AttributeSetInfo TermListInfo
      ExtendedServicesInfo AttributeDetails TermListDetails
      ElementSetDetails RetrivalRecordDetails SortDetails Processing
      VariantSetInfo UnitSet
    * Test support of bolean operators: and or not
    * Test what services the target supports

Apart from that Z-Spy has the following features:

    * When a server closes the connection in the middel of a test, Z-Spy
      can reconnect and continue the test where it crashed.
    * When a test has failed n number of times, with the same error, an
      email is send to the sys admin.
    * Z-Spy can put a sleap in between the serches in order not to
      stress the target too much
    * To begin with a query with a common word is used, until a record
      has been found so that the record format test can be performed.
      When this record has been formed, the query is switched to
      something more uncommon like "askdndd" in order to stress the
      server as little as possible.
