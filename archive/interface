I can make some HTML if you like but I don't think that I can make 
something that you can't make even better. Any way let me start by 
trying to describe the functionality I envisions, if this thing is gong 
to take over ZSpy's role today.

We need a fairly simple interface for non authenticated users to add new 
servers to the repository, something like the current Z-Spy interface: 
http://targettest.indexdata.com/newtarget.php, but nicer :-). In 
addition to the fields on the current page, I would like the ability to 
say what kind of organization is hosting the database eg. public 
library, academic library, corporate library and other. If we really 
want to make it fancy we should also add the ability to say what 
subjects are strongly represented in this databases, like medicine, 
engineering, theology, etc. but I am just afraid that there will be so 
few servers where this info is available for that it will be a waist of 
time to add this.

When you have filled out the fields, where only the name, host name, 
port and database name are mandatory fields, a series of checks should 
happen before the server is added: First we should check if the server 
is already registered under that host name/IP (make a DNS lookup) port 
and database. If it is not, the second check should be a simple init and 
connect test. If this test fails I think that we should tell the user 
but it should still be possible to add the server.

The administrator interface should give the ability to browse through 
the servers in the repository, a simple list with all servers beginning 
with a, b, c, ..., like the current Target directory interface, is fine 
by me. Under each server you should be able to view all the data that 
was entered and collected by the robot. You should also have the ability 
to edit and delete the servers.

I am not sure how many people ever view the current target statistics 
http://targettest.indexdata.com/stat.php but personally I find it 
extremely interesting, and I would love if we can reimplement that, but 
maybe it doesn't have to be in the first version.

How is that for a first shot at a requirements spec?
