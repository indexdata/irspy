Revision history for Perl extension ZOOM::IRSpy.

1.01  Mon Jul 16 12:51:19 BST 2007
	- Web UI pages to add or upload a new target are now publicly
	  accessible -- although admin privileges are still required
	  to edit the newly added records, since there is no simple
	  way to know that the person editing a record is the same
	  person who first added it.
	- When adding new records via the Web UI, the port number is
	  guessed from the protocol if not explicitly stated.
	- Note that Web UI's ZeeRex upload expects just the ZeeRex
	  record, not an entire SRU explainResponse.

1.00  Mon Jul  9 10:42:06 BST 2007
	- First public release.
	- Many, many changes since 0.02.

0.02  Wed Jun 27 12:09:49 BST 2007
	- Renamed from Net::Z3950::IRSpy to ZOOM::IRSpy
	- Fix display of non-ASCII characters in, for example, the
	    list of targets beginning with "R".
	- Change targets() API to accept a Perl list rather than a
	    space-separated string.
	- Change check.html parameters to cleanly accept multiple
	    target IDs even if they contain spaces.
	- Proper URL-encoding of all link parameters.
	- Proper HTML-quoting of all output.
	- Capture YAZ logging output for web display.
	- Add Dublin Core record format to Zebra configuration.
	- Much better "Add a target" form, including:
		- Name
		- URL to hosting organisation
		- Email to technical contact
		- Username/password if needed
		- Type of library (Academic, Public, Corporate,
		    Special, National, Education or Other)
		- Country.
	- "Add another database to this target" button.
	- Form for editing details of an existing target.
	- Require authentication for database-changing operations
		such as target testing, adding a new target and
		editing and existing one.
	- Add statistics page like that one at
		http://targettest.indexdata.com/stat.php
	- Record deletion and ID change works correctly even when the
	  ID contains spaces or non-ASCII characters.
	- Many, many more enhancements.
