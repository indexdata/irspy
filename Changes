Revision history for Perl extension ZOOM::IRSpy.

TODO
	### Fix display of non-ASCII characters in, for example, the
	    list of targets beginning with "R".
	### Change targets() API to accept a Perl list rather than a
	    space-separated string.
	### Change check.html parameters to cleanly accept multiple
	    target IDs even if they contain spaces.
	### Add Dublin Core record format to Zebra configuration.
	### Much better "Add a target" form, including:
		- Name
		- URL to hosting organisation
		- Email to technical contact
		- Username/password if needed
		- Type of library (Academic, Public, Corporate,
		    Special, National, Education or Other)
		- Country.
	### When adding a new database, check for pre-existence, using
	    IP address/hostname canonicalisation.
	### Ability to add target by uploading a ZeeRex record.
	### "Add another database to this target" button.
	### Form for editing details of an existing target.
	### Maybe require authentication for database-changing
	    operations such as target testing, adding a new target and
	    editing and existing one.
	### Capture YAZ logging output for web display.
	### Make full-record display for target records.
	### Link from target-test results to full and raw records.
	### Mark targets that persistently don't respond.
	### Email administrative contact on failure.
	### Add statistics page like that one at
		http://targettest.indexdata.com/stat.php
