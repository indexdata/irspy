For some totally irrational, retarded and undocumented reason, the <a>
element in XHTML 1.0 Strict does not have the "target" element, so
instead I have to use XHTML 1.0 Transitional.  Well, great.  If you
enjoy reading TOTALLY unhelpful answers, try
	http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#target
which says:

	Why was the target attribute removed from XHTML 1.1?

	It wasn't. XHTML 1.0 comes in three versions: strict,
	transitional, and frameset. All three of these were
	deliberately kept as close as possible to HTML 4.01 as
	XML would allow. XHTML 1.1 is an updated version of
	XHTML 1.0 strict, and no version of HTML strict has
	ever included the target attribute. The other two
	versions, transitional and frameset, were not updated,
	because there was nothing to update. If you want to
	use the target attribute, use XHTML 1.0 transitional.

And, yes, this is the ONLY mention of "target" in the W3C's FAQ.

If you want slightly more information, a thread at
	http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread96361.html
asks and answers the question:

	If this attribute is indeed deprecated, which seems to
	be the case, is there an alternative to
	target="_blank" to open hyperlinks in a new/blank
	window?

	Not that I know of, other than using javascript.

Nice one, W3C!  Way to improve cross-browser portability!
