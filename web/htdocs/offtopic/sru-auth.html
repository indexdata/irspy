	In order to test the authentication feature of Simple2ZOOM, we
	need an authenticator script, accessible via HTTP.  The
	simplest way to provide that is as a simple bit of HTML::Mason
	running under the conveniently available IRSpy distribution.
	Since this is only for testing, a hardwired user register is
	good enough.

<%args>
$user => undef
$pass => undef
</%args>
<%once>
our %register = (
    mike => "fish",
    simon => "frog 123",
    admin => "Tom&jErry",
);
</%once>
<%perl>
if (defined $user && defined $pass && $register{$user} eq $pass) {
    print "OK\n";
    return;
} else {
    $m->clear_buffer;
    $m->abort(401); # "Authorization Required"
}
</%perl>
