   For Z39.50 databases, contains the name of the Z39.50 database
   which the service provides.  If the service provides multiple
   databases, then a separate target record must be made for each.
   This can most easily be done using the <tt>Copy target</tt> link in
   the menu.

   For SRW and SRU, this element is used to contain the the remainder
   of the URL to the server, omitting any preceeding '/' character.
   For example, a target record describing the SRU service at
   <tt>http://z3950.loc.gov:7090/voyager</tt>,
   the database name would be <tt>voyager</tt>, but for a service at
   <tt>http://test.com:8080/foo/cgi-bin/server</tt>
   it would be <tt>foo/cgi-bin/server</tt>.
