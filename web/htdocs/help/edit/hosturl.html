  <p>
   A URL for the organisation which hosts the database.  This URL may
   or not refer to the same host as the
   <a href="/help.html?help=edit/host">Host</a>
   on which the service runs - for example, the Library of Congress
   catalogue runs on the host z3950.loc.gov, but
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/"
                           >http://www.loc.gov/</a>
   would be a more approriate host URL.
