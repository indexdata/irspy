   The author element should contain the name of the person or
   organisation to be credited with the creation of the database, and
   may include some form or address, either electronic or postal, as
   well as the name.

  <p>
   Contrast with
   <a href="/help.html?help=edit/contact">Contact</a>,
   which is adminstrative rather than to do with giving credit.  While
   the author and contact entities may be the same, they may not.
