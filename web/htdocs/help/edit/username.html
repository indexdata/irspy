   Some Z39.50 servers require authentication before access is
   allowed.  For such servers, a suitable username and password may be
   provided.  Server that require authentication but for which no
   username/password is provided cannot be tested.

   At the time of writing there is no standard way to provide
   authentication to SRU/SRW services, so these fields are of limited
   utility for such services.
