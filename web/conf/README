To install the web UI (assuming you're using some version of Apache as
your web server):

-- First, make sure that the IRSpy code runs OK outside the context of
   a web-server.  Build and test it as you would any Perl module, with
   "perl Makefile.PL && make && make test".  There's no need to
   install it, though.  Among the prerequisites are ZOOM-Perl and
   XML::LibXML::XPathContext: unfortunately neither of these is
   packaged for Debian, so they must be installed from CPAN. If you insist
   on installing these packages as debian packages, first install the
   tool dh-make-perl, i.e. apt-get install dh-make-perl. Then execute this:

     dh-make-perl --build --cpan XML::LibXML::XPathContext

   After a lot of output has been generated, you should have a .deb file one
   directory step back. Install it using dpkg -i package-xxx.deb. For the
   IRSpy package, just cd into the base directory of the source tree, and
   execute

     dh-make-perl --build

   which will give you a .deb package one directory step back.
   
   You'll also need a 2.0-series Zebra installation to run the database.

-- Make a config file for the host you're on, probably by making a
   modified copy of apache1.3/xeno.conf

-- Include this configuration in that of the web server.  For example,
   if you're using the Apache 1.3 setup that is the default on
   Debian-based operating systems, go to /etc/apache/conf.d and:
	# ln -s /usr/local/src/cvs/irspy/web/conf/apache1.3/XXX.conf irspy.conf

-- Restart the web-server or otherwise tell it about the change to its
   configurations, for example using "apachectl restart".

-- Make sure that the web-server's user (often root, www-data or
   nobody) can write the logs in in the ../logs directory: for
   example, you might use "chmod ugo+w ."

-- Make sure that you can read the logs that it generates: for
   example, you might use:
	# chmod ugo+r access.log error.log

-- Make sure you have the HTML::Mason Perl module installed, including
   all its prerequisites (most notably mod_perl itself).  On
   Debian-based operating systems, this is as simple as
	# apt-get install libhtml-mason-perl libapache-request-perl \
                          libapache-reload-perl

-- Ensure that the web server can write the HTML::Mason object
   directory and cache directory.  For example:
	chmod ugo+w data/obj data/cache

That should be everything: just start Zebra, point your browser to the
root of your new virtual host, and off you go.
