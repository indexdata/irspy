# Sample configuration for running an IRSpy web-site under Apache 1.3.
#
# This is the configuration that I use on the staging machine,
# test, which is a PC running Debian GNU/Linux 3.1.
# On this machine, the IRSpy software is at
#	/usr/local/src/cvs/irspy
#
# This file can be included in the Apache configuration by adding a
# line like this to apache.conf or one of its included files:
#	Include /usr/local/src/cvs/irspy/web/conf/apache1.3/test.conf
#
# When running on Debian, don't forget to
# install libapache-request-perl as well as libhtml-mason-perl,
# otherwise Mason will fail mysteriously.
